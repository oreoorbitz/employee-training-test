// store every product card to a variable, using querySelectorAll
// convert that variable to an array, because querySelectorAll doesn't return an array
// create a function that takes an array. In the function, map through the array of DOM elements, and extract the price and quantity of each card. multiply the price by the quantity, and return the result
