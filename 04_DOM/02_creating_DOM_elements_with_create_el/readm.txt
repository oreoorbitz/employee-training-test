Is this module, you'll taken product data from an imaginary product API, and rendering out product cards on the page.
You have used the create element method before, the key concepts in this module will the cloneNode method, and event delegation

1. create an <article> for each product object in the imaginary API
2. inside of the article tag, put a h1 tag, using the value from the "title" key of the product object
3. inside of the article tag, put an img tag, using the value from the "featured_image" key of the product object
4. inside of the article tag, create an button tag, with the text of add to cart, give it a data-attribute of "product-id" and in that attribute, 
put the value from the product object's "product_id" key
5. Append these newly created elements into the page, in the div with a class of row
6. When a user clicks on the button in the article tags, an alert should appear with the text" product ${product_id} has been added to cart!"
